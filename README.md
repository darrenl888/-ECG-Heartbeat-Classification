This repository provides a clean end-to-end deep learning pipeline for:
- Preprocessing raw ECG recordings into standardized heartbeat windows
- Classifying each beat by **morphology** (e.g., normal, supraventricular, ventricular, etc.)
- Screening for underlying **heart disease** (normal vs abnormal)
- Generating smart, clinical-style interpretation summaries

Predictions are made using two separately trained CNN+LSTM models:
- `mitbih_model.h5` â€” trained on **MIT-BIH Arrhythmia Dataset** for 5-class beat classification
- `ptbdb_model.h5` â€” trained on **PTB Diagnostic ECG Dataset** for binary disease screening

## ðŸ§  Model Training (CNN + LSTM)

This repo includes code to train both classification models from scratch using a hybrid **CNN + LSTM** architecture:

| Model   | Dataset | Output Classes |
|---------|---------|----------------|
| MIT-BIH |5-class: Normal, SVEB, VEB, Fusion, Unknown | Normal, SVEB, VEB, Fusion, Unknown |
| PTBDB   |2-class: Normal, Abnormal | Normal, Abnormal |


Training highlights:
- Convolutional layers extract local ECG features
- LSTM layers capture sequential dependencies
- Trained using **focal loss**, early stopping, and class balancing
- Final models exported to `.h5` for seamless downstream inference

Use the `CNN+LSTM Models.ipynb` to retrain or modify architectures.

## âš¡ How It Works

1. **Preprocessing**  
   ECG signal is:
   - Bandpass filtered (0.5â€“40 Hz)
   - R-peaks detected using NeuroKit2
   - Centered 187-sample beats extracted
   - Noisy / multi-peak / tachycardic beats optionally flagged or dropped

2. **Prediction**  
   Each extracted beat is:
   - Fed into **two TensorFlow models** independently
   - Predictions are made **per beat**
   - Final output is the **mean prediction across all beats**

3. **Smart Reporting**  
   Combined summary includes:
   - Predicted beat type + confidence
   - Disease status + confidence
   - Explanation of possible contradictions
   - Clinical-style flag if abnormality is detected
